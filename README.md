# Final project for 2023's 219114/115 Programming I
* Starting files for part 1
  - database.py
  - project_manage.py
  - persons.csv

i didn't finish a lot of work here , i intend to create a class to working with that class attribute to
csv files but i don't understand how to put new data to csv file from coding ,
work i didn't finish:
1. all class user but some of them i implements some method already
2. exit
3. way to verify that user role to grant a class for that role

this is how i think this program'll do
if a lead request someone to be a member request data will go to the Invitations.csv file and 
if others student login they can see a request by using method inside class 
faculty same as student if they have a request
everything in here are involved to those csv files
